;; TERMINAL MANAGEMENT STUFF ;;
;; Predefined commands
;; You can switch to any terminal with SPC l
;; You can search the commands with SPC o t
;; You can send any text to any terminal by selecting and pressing SPC l
;; You can quickly execute a define command with SPC j + the keybinding you defined.
