The configuration options are:

* "Use a single list for fields": Boolean (i.e. ```true``` or ```false```). It controls what is shown in the ```fields``` menu. If true, every single field of every note type is in the same list. If false, fields will be grouped by note type into sub-menus.

* "Show internal fields": Enable even more columns that map to database fields related to the cards and notes (dev option)

* "Table content": Either:
  * "No interaction": the table content can't be interacted with
  * "Selectable": it can be selected. All edition will be ignored
  * "Editable": Allow to edit some values directly in the table. Not all.
